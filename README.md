# Azra_Test_Proj

used vector2.reflect instead of investing more time to make the bounce pad mechanic. didn't come out exactly the way I wanted to but done to save time

Hunter movement not supposed to use physics with update but it was a shortcut because otherwise movement is too sluggish and floaty

basic enemies can sometimes get locked in the corners temporarily because my code randomizes which direction away from the first contact of the wall, this was a shortcut so I didn't have to track its transform to have it redirect more towards the center
